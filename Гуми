There is no direct programming code available to calculate the square of a planet, as planets do not have a square value. However, you can write a program to calculate the square of a number, which can be used to represent the area of a planetary orbit. Here's a combined solution using C and Python programming languages based on the provided sources:

**C Program to Calculate Square of a Number**

```c
/* C Program to Calculate Square of a Number */
#include<stdio.h>

int Calculate_Square (int Number);

int main() {
    int number, Square;
    printf(" \n Please enter a number: ");
    scanf("%d", &number);
    Square = Calculate_Square(number);
    printf("The square of %d is %d.\n", number, Square);
    return 0;
}

int Calculate_Square (int Number) {
    return Number * Number;
}
```

**Python Program to Calculate Square of a Given Number**

```python
def calculate_square(number):
    return number * number

number = int(input("Please enter a number: "))
square = calculate_square(number)
print(f"The square of {number} is {square}.")
```

These programs allow you to input a number and then calculate its square. You can use this concept to represent the area of a planetary orbit by squaring the distance from the planet to the sun. However, remember that planets do not have a square value themselves.
